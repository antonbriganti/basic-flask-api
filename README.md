# basic-flask-api 

This is actually an implementation of [a techincal test MYOB's O&A function uses](https://github.com/myob-oss/ops-technical-test) but I called it something different to make it less searchable

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/antonbriganti/basic-flask-api.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/antonbriganti/basic-flask-api)

## Application Overview ðŸ–¥

### Technologies used
Basic web API, built in Python and Flask.
The application is packaged into a Docker image (not currently published) and can be run locally via `docker-compose`.

### Endpoints available 
Three endpoints exist in the API
- `/` - returns `hello world` as `text/html` content type
- `/health` - returns status of application in a JSON response
- `/metadata` - returns app's version and description, as well as the SHA of the current git commit

### Running the application
If you want to run the application locally with the correct git commit SHA, you can use the included script:

```
./run-locally.sh
```

Otherwise, you can just manually use `docker-compose`, which will use a default SHA:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up app
```

### Testing the application
Run the included script, which will run the tests using `docker-compose` 
```
./ops/test.sh
```

### Running linting
Run the included script, which will run the linting using `docker-compose` 
```
./ops/lint.sh
```

For linters I used `black` and `flake8`. Usually I just use `pylint` but I find it too strict out of the box so I tried a new solution with `flake8`. I added `black` because it's a handy way to auto adjust code with minimal effort from me.

## Build Pipeline Overview ðŸ› 
Application is built and tested using Travis CI, which was used because it's free and configurable via code (YAML file)

### Steps included
Pretty basic setup:

0. **Linting step** - Used to make sure code style is always consistent.
1. **Build step** - Used to make sure the docker image actually builds correctly (ensuring following failures will be relevant only to tests)
2. **Test step** - Running tests using `docker-compose`. This was done to make sure the pipeline is using the exact setup that I have locally, as opposed to worrying about if the build agents have `python`, `pip`, etc.

If I were to deploy this, the pipeline would continue as follows:

3. **Publish image** - Publish the docker image to a repository, tagging it with the build number, git commit SHA and `latest`
4. **Deploy application** - Deploy to cloud service (heroku maybe?), using the build number for the image identifier, i.e. `anton-ops-test:10`. 

## Thoughts and concerns on application ðŸ’­
- Right now the version and description are hard coded in, but ideally in the future it would follow the same pattern that is used for passing in git commit SHA
- The git commit SHA is being baked into the image itself via passing in argument. If the command used to pass it in fails, the build will still go ahead, using the default value noted in the Dockerfile. This means an incorrect value could be pushed out to "production", which is obviously bad
- Dependency management is very all or nothing, in that no matter what is happening all dependencies are installed. A more mature solution should probably have it be separated, with different dependency files for different purposes, i.e. one for testing, one for application, one for linting. 
    - I did try doing it but I found it a little too complex to easily achieve due to the nature of multiple dependencies being introduced per dependency
    - It's probably not a big problem for a small app like this but I can see it being an issue if it got any larger
- I didn't create a new image target for just linting due to the state my dependency management was in. I feel like I cheated but it does the job so I guess that's fine
- A big dumb issue is Docker's rate limiting so my tests on the CI/CD may fail if too many pulls are done. This is out of my control.
